"""What this machine is willing to render right now.

Runs on the render host, not on the bot's. The point of moving renders onto a
laptop is that the laptop is six times the server; the price is that it is also
somebody's laptop, and a render that makes it unusable — or that empties its
battery in a bag — costs more than it saves.

So a job is not taken unconditionally. The machine is asked four questions, all
of them answerable from `pmset` and `ioreg` without any daemon of our own:

- **Is it on battery, and how much is left?** Below the floor the job goes back
  and the server renders it. Above it, the render takes half the machine.
- **Has the operator asked for low power?** If macOS is in that mode they have
  said what they want; overriding it with our own arithmetic would be rude.
- **Is anyone at the keyboard?** Idle means the machine is ours; a hand on the
  trackpad means we get out of the way.
- **Is it already hot?** Thermal pressure drops us a tier rather than adding to
  it.

The numbers below were measured on the encoder half of a render, on an M4 Pro
(8 performance cores, 4 efficiency), at 720p60 veryfast/CRF 20:

    threads   wall     load    CPU-seconds
    2         1.90s    284%    5.31
    4         1.78s    324%    5.58
    6         1.07s    566%    5.57
    12        0.89s    779%    6.12
    taskpolicy -b   9.94s    208%    19.53

Two things in that table decided the policy. Total CPU work barely moves with
the thread cap, so capping threads does *not* meaningfully save charge — it
buys heat, fan noise and a responsive machine, which is worth buying for its
own sake but is not a battery measure. And the option that looks gentlest,
demoting the process to the background tier, burned three times the CPU work
for the same video: it is the worst thing available on battery, not the best.

The drawing half of a render scales differently and has not been measured — it
needs a real replay to render. When it is, these splits are what to revisit.

    the bot's lease runs out and it renders the job itself, and the laptop wakes
    up minutes later, finishes a render nobody is waiting for, and tries to
    upload it into a job that is no longer its own.

    `caffeinate` is macOS's own answer and it is exactly scoped: it holds the

    blocks system sleep — that last one only has an effect on mains power, which
    is the case this is for.

    What it cannot do is override a closed lid. Nothing can, so the worker has
    to survive it happening anyway — see how a lost lease stops a render in
