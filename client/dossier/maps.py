"""Getting the beatmap a replay was played on.

An `.osr` names its map by MD5 and nothing else — no id, no title. So the hash
goes to the osu! API to become a beatmap, and from there two things are fetched
for two different reasons.

**The `.osu` comes from osu! itself** — `osu.ppy.sh/osu/<id>`, no key, answers for
every map that exists. This is what judging needs, and it is not allowed to
depend on a third party.

**The `.osz` comes from a mirror**, best-effort, and carries the song. A render
without audio is half a render, so it is worth trying; it is not worth failing
over. A graveyard map, a map missing from the mirror, or a mirror simply down
used to end with a replay nobody could judge. Now it ends with a silent video,
and the reason is logged.
