"""Render replays for the bot, on this machine.

Run from a checkout of this repo on whichever machine should do the rendering —
the point of it is a laptop that is several times the server the bot lives on.
It needs the engine built (`cargo build --release`) and two lines in
`~/.dossier/worker.env`, after which there is nothing to type:

    RENDER_SERVER=https://example.org
    RENDER_WORKER_TOKEN=...

    $ python client/worker.py --check   # is this set up?
    $ python client/worker.py           # then run it

Two lines, not four. It used to want osu! API credentials as well, because
turning a replay's map hash into a beatmap needed an account — and that step
is where most people setting a worker up got stuck. The bot has already done
that lookup by the time it offers the job, so now it sends the answer along
and a worker needs no osu! account at all.

`--check` answers every question at once rather than one `SystemExit` at a
time, and it reaches the bot without claiming anybody's replay.

It pulls rather than listens. Nothing has to be reachable from outside, no port
is opened, no address has to stay put — which matters because the machine this
is for sits behind a home router and moves. A worker that is off simply stops
claiming, and the bot renders on its own host a few seconds later.

Runs on macOS, Linux and Windows. How hard it works is not this file's decision:
`machine` reads the battery, the energy mode, whether anyone is
at the keyboard and whether the machine is hot, and answers with thread counts —
or with a refusal, which is respected by not claiming anything at all. What each
platform can answer differs; the policy that reads the answers does not.
