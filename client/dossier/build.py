"""Which build of the engine a machine is about to render with.

A render farm worker runs its own checkout and its own `cargo build`. Nothing
has ever made it say so, so a worker whose binary is behind the bot's renders
with old code, produces output that looks perfectly plausible, and no one finds
out until somebody notices the pictures are wrong. That is the same shape as a
skin folder unpacked by an importer since fixed, and that one cost a long
evening before it was found — the lesson being that stale *inputs* are worse
than broken ones, because broken announces itself.

So the engine stamps itself with the source it was built from and can be asked:

    $ dossier --version
    dossier 0.1.0 (15abdf1)

The manifest version is not the useful half — it has never been bumped and
never will be by hand. The id is, and it is the only identity two machines can
compare: a hash of the binary would differ between a Linux build and a macOS
one of the same source, which is exactly the pair that needs comparing.

It is deliberately *not* the commit. It was, and this module stopped the farm
over it: a worker was refused with "the bot renders with 8aae009 and this
worker with 6054b39" when the entire difference between those commits was one
markdown file. The id now covers the crates, the lockfile and the workspace
manifest and nothing else — see `crates/dossier-cli/build.rs` for why those
three and how they are folded into one word.

## What a disagreement means

Refusal. A worker whose build differs from the bot's is turned away and the bot
renders the job itself, which is the fallback the farm is built around anyway —
so the cost of being strict is a slower render, and the cost of being lax is a
wrong one nobody notices.

`unknown` is not a match and not a mismatch. A binary built without git to ask
cannot say what it is, and two of those are not thereby the same. They are let
through, once loudly: a farm that stops working because somebody built from a
tarball has failed at something that was never its business.
