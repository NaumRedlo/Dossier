//! What the corpus *is*, written down.
//!
//! For months the corpus was whatever a `find` command happened to match on
//! one machine. That was found out the hard way: twelve replays were sitting
//! in a directory nobody had thought to point it at, and every number this
//! project had published was taken without them. A measurement whose inputs
//! are discovered rather than declared is not reproducible, and a number that
//! cannot be reproduced is not a measurement.
//!
//! So the set is named here, by the one thing about a replay that does not
//! change: the MD5 of the file. Filenames vary, the same replay sits in two
//! folders, a download gets `(2)` appended. The hash does not.
//!
//! The replays themselves are not in the repository and will not be — they are
//! other people's plays. What is here is enough to say whether the set on this
//! machine is the set the numbers were taken from, and to go and fetch the
//! beatmaps for it.
//!
//! Each row also carries what that replay is *expected* to do. A single total
//! held to a ceiling hides trades: two replays can get worse while a third
//! gets better and the sum will not move. Per-replay expectations do not
//! allow that.
