"""Skins the bot holds, and getting one out of an `.osk`.

An `.osk` is a zip somebody sent us, which is the whole reason this file is
careful. Three things can go wrong with a stranger's archive and all three are
guarded here rather than hoped about:

- **A path that escapes the folder.** `../../.ssh/authorized_keys` is a valid
  zip entry name. Nothing here builds a path out of one: only the last segment
  of an entry is used, so an escaping name becomes a file called `passwd` in
  the store and goes no further. The realpath check that follows is a guard
  against that reasoning being wrong, not the defence itself — if it ever
  fires, the import stops rather than continuing on a wrong assumption.
- **An archive that unpacks to more than the disk holds.** A few hundred
  kilobytes of zip can be gigabytes of zeroes, so the declared total is checked
  first and the written total is counted as it goes, because the declaration is
  the attacker's to write.
- **Depth.** osu! reads only the top of a skin folder, so nothing below it is
  worth keeping and subdirectories are dropped on the way in. That is also what
  the renderer does when it reads one — see `dossier-render`'s `imported.rs`,
  and the `cursors/` folder that taught it.

What comes out is a folder the engine can be pointed at with `--skin`.

# What unpacking a skin does, as a number that goes up when it changes.
#
# A skin folder is unpacked once and used for ever after, so a fix to the
# unpacking does nothing for the skins already in the store — they keep the
# result of the code that was running the day they arrived, and they keep it
# silently. That is not a hypothetical: the root-first rule below was added
# after `vv_idke_trail` imported with the wrong combo numbers and the wrong hit
# sounds, and every folder unpacked before it stayed wrong afterwards. Forty-two
# files of it, including every core hit sound, and it took an evening to find
# because nothing anywhere said the folder was old.
#
# So each folder records which unpacking made it, and a folder made by an older
# one is *reported*. It cannot be repaired here: the store keeps the unpacked
# skin and not the `.osk`, so the only way back is somebody sending the archive
# again. Saying so is the whole job.
#
# Bump this whenever `_extract` or `_to_wav` changes what comes out.
