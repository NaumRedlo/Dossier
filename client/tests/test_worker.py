"""The worker's side of the bargain: call the engine right, survive, and let go.

Three groups, each from something that actually happened on the laptop this is
written for.

A reel went out to it and the worker died on `exhibit() got an unexpected
keyword argument 'threads'` — one engine command had grown the resource controls
and the other had not, and the worker calls the two identically.

That mistake was small and the damage was not: the exception was not one of the
ones `_render` catches, so it escaped to `main`, killed the process, and left the
job leased to a machine that no longer existed. A worker has to hand back what it
cannot do and keep answering.

And a replay sent from out of the house was rendered at home into nothing: the
Mac slept partway through, the lease ran out, and the laptop woke to finish a
render nobody would collect. Two answers — hold the machine awake for exactly as
long as the engine runs, and stop rendering the moment the job stops being ours.
