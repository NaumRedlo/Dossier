//! Scorers propose; selection disposes.
//!
//! Five steps, in this order, and the order is the design:
//!
//! 1. **Every scorer answers in the same units** — [`Candidate::strength`],
//!    from 0 to 1, meaning how much of what that scorer can detect is present.
//!    A scorer must not be able to win by using a bigger unit: combo runs into
//!    the hundreds and milliseconds saved into the tens, and left raw the whole
//!    ranking would be an accident of what each signal happens to be measured
//!    in. Each scorer states what its 1.0 means; see [`crate::Candidate`] for
//!    why this is absolute rather than relative to a scorer's own best.
//! 2. **Weight between scorers.** The one place taste is applied, and it is a
//!    table in [`Scorer::weight`] rather than a thumb on any scorer's scale.
//! 3. **Take best-first while there is anything worth taking** — stopping at
//!    [`Settings::worth`] rather than at a length, because how long a reel
//!    should be is a property of the play. The budget is a ceiling over that,
//!    and there are two more constraints: no overlap, and no two clips from
//!    the same stretch unless nothing else qualifies.
//! 4. **Order by time.** A highlight reel that jumps backwards through the map
//!    is disorienting however good each clip is on its own.
//! 5. **Snap each clip to a beat**, using the timing already carried for the
//!    break arrows. A cut that lands off the beat reads as a mistake even to
//!    someone who could not say why.
