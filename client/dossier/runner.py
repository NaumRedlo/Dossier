    Nothing is returned: the engine writes a file and reports progress on
    stderr. Minutes, not seconds — a two-minute map at 720p is around two and a
    half — so this gets its own timeout rather than the one sized for judging.

    The skin comes from settings rather than being fixed here: which look the
    bot renders in is a deployment's decision, not this function's.

    Returns what the engine said about the render — thread count, the timing
    breakdown — which is the only way to tell a render that is slow because the
    encoder is saturated from one that is slow because it is drawing on one
    core. It was being captured and discarded, so nobody could see either.
