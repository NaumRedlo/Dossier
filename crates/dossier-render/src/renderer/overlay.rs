//! The things that happen over the play rather than being part of it: the fail
//! as the health empties and the screen reddens, the danger vignette on a play
//! near death, the verdicts that pop and shrink as notes are judged, and the

//!
//! These are reactions to the state of the play, not readouts about it — which
//! is why a bare render keeps the danger and the fail and drops the rest. Four
//! are `pub(super)` for the frame's passes to call: `compose_fail` from the
//! fail path, `draw_danger` from both the bare and full overlays,
//! `draw_verdicts` and `draw_break_warning` from the play pass. `beat_kick`,
//! which pulses the break arrows on the music's beat, is theirs alone.
