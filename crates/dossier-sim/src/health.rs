//! Health, in both clients' models.
//!
//! Roughly half the replays in the corpus carry osu!'s own life-bar graph in
//! their header, and for those there is nothing to model — the game already
//! said what the bar did. The other half carry nothing at all, and a renderer
//! that only draws the bar when the replay happens to have brought one is a
//! renderer whose HUD changes shape for no reason the viewer can see.
//!
//! So this computes it. The half that *do* carry a graph are the test: the
//! model is measured against them rather than trusted.
//!
//! The two clients disagree about almost everything here. stable does not have
//! a drain formula at all — it *solves* for the drain, running a perfect play
//! over and over and nudging the rate until that play finishes with the bar
//! where the difficulty says it should be. lazer does the same thing by binary
//! search over a much simpler curve. Neither can be written down as an
//! expression in HP, which is why "the drain rate is HP × something" is wrong
//! for every map ever made.
