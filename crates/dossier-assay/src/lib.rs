//! What a map is worth, and what a play on it is worth — ppy's arithmetic,
//! ported.
//!
//! The bot showed a star rating the game disagreed with and a pp figure twice
//! what the game gives, and each was patched by asking ppy directly. That works
//! and it is what ships today, but it can only answer questions ppy has an
//! endpoint for: it will say what a map is worth with mods on it, and what a
//! finished play scored, and nothing else. It will not say what a play would
//! have been worth without the misses, and it cannot be asked sixty times a
//! second while a render draws.
//!
//! The port that filled those gaps is behind — 0.20 to 0.82 stars out on the
//! same map and mods — and there is no newer release to move to. So: our own,
//! against ppy's sources.
//!
//! # Why this is tractable
//!
//! The expensive half of a difficulty calculation is not the arithmetic, it is
//! everything underneath it — parsing the map, working out slider curves,
//! stacking, timing, applying mods to both the numbers and the geometry. That
//! is already here, written for the renderer and exercised by every frame it
//! draws: [`dossier_beatmap`] parses and holds the curves,
//! [`dossier_sim::Timeline`] resolves objects under mods with their stacks and
//! their slider ticks. This crate is the layer above.
//!
//! An assay is the test that tells you how much of the precious metal is in the
//! ore. This one is handed a map and a play and asked the same question, which
//! is why it is called that, and it sits beside `dossier-exhibit` in taking its
//! name from the business of putting evidence in front of somebody.
//!
//! # How it is kept honest
//!
//! ppy's attributes endpoint answers with the official numbers for any map with
//! any mods, and `corpus/` holds its answers beside the maps they describe. So
//! every figure here has something to be wrong against, from the first one:
//! `corpus/expected.json` carries the star rating and eight attributes for
//! fifteen mod sets on ten maps, and the tests check ours against theirs.
//!
//! Regenerating the corpus is also how a rebalance is noticed. ppy change these
//! formulas several times a year and announce it nowhere this code would see;
//! rerun `scripts/pp_corpus.py` and a diff on the corpus is a diff on their
//! arithmetic.
//!
//! # What is here so far
//!
//! [`max_combo`], and it is a real first step rather than a placeholder: the
//! largest combo a map allows counts every circle, every slider head, tail,
//! repeat and tick, and every spinner, so agreeing with ppy on it means the
//! slider tick spacing and the repeat handling underneath are right. Those are
//! what the difficulty calculation walks over.
