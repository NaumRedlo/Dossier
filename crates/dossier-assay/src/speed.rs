//! How hard the map is to *press* — the first skill, and the first thing here
//! that ppy will grade.
//!
//! `speed_difficulty` comes back from the attributes endpoint for every map and
//! mod set in the corpus, so unlike the preprocessing underneath it this can be
//! marked right or wrong outright. It is also what marks the preprocessing:
//! rhythm reads the gaps, double-tapping reads the jump distances, and a
//! mistake in either shows up here as a number that is simply not ppy's.
//!
//! Three pieces, in the order they feed each other:
//!
//! 1. [`speed_difficulty_of`] — how hard one press is, from the gap before it.
//! 2. [`rhythm_multiplier_of`] — how much harder that press is for coming in an
//!    awkward rhythm, judged against the five seconds of play behind it.
//! 3. [`Speed`] — the two combined into a strain that decays between objects,
//!    and the strains summed with the hardest counting most.
