//! How hard the map is to *point at* — the three readings of aim, and the one
//! that gets used.
//!
//! osu! no longer has a single aim skill. It has three evaluators, and the map
//! decides between them object by object:
//!
//! - [`snap_difficulty_of`] — stopping the cursor on each note. Rewards
//!   velocity, sharp turns, sudden changes of speed, and sliders.
//! - [`flow_difficulty_of`] — never stopping, riding through the notes in one
//!   motion. Rewards the same velocity differently and punishes erratic angles.
//! - [`agility_difficulty_of`] — plain speed of hand over short distances,
//!   which is what makes snapping a stream unreasonable.
//!
//! Snap and agility are added as a p-norm, and that sum is weighed against flow
//! by a logistic on their ratio: a player is assumed to do whichever is easier,
//! and the two probabilities sum to one. The comment in ppy's source explains
//! why agility is on the snap side — snapping every circle of a stream demands
//! so much of it that flowing wins, which is the answer you want.
//!
//! Ported from `SnapAimEvaluator`, `FlowAimEvaluator` and `AgilityEvaluator`,
//! with the `Aim` skill that consumes them. It sums its strains differently
//! from [`crate::speed`] — over sections of variable length rather than
//! harmonically — and that model lives in [`crate::strain`].
