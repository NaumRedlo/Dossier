"""A skin must not overwrite itself on the way in.

Reported as a skin importing with the wrong combo numbers and the wrong hit
sounds, which looked like the map's. It was neither: `vv_idke_trail` ships 41
names twice — `default-0.png` beside `num/default-0.png`, and every hit sound in
the root beside a copy in `hitsound/` — and flattening let whichever landed last
win. osu! reads the root and never opens those folders, so the file that won was
one the game would never have used.
