//! K1, K2, M1 and M2, as osu! shows them — and which device a press belongs to
//! is not a bit you can read on its own, because the game sets the mouse bit
//! whenever a key is down. The count and the depth of a box are read from a table built
//! at the start — `KeyTrack` — so a frame answers "how many presses by now" with
//! a binary search rather than a walk, and answers it from the instant alone,
//! which is what lets every frame be drawn in parallel.
//!
//! `KeyTrack` and its `build` are `pub(super)`: the `Scene` holds one as a field
//! and builds it once when the scene is made. `draw_keys` is `pub(super)` for the
//! overlay pass; `draw_key_trail` is its own.
